Lesson on Twitter Social Network Analysis

This is an interactive introductory lesson that covers the following topics:

1. Very short introduction to Python/Jupyter/NumPy and matplotlib,
2. Tweet collection using the Twitter Streaming API (using tweepy),
3. Creation and analysis of the network of interactions between Twitter users (using networkx),
4. Basics of supervised machine learning classification,
5. Sentiment analysis applied to the Twitter interaction network (using sci-kit learn).

I made it using [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/). You can see it directly on github or download the files and run them on your machine.
You need to have python3 installed with [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
